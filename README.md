# Running the Program
## To execute the program, use the make command with the INPUT variable specified as the input filename:
- make INPUT="input_filename"


# Example
## To use test.txt as the input file:
- make INPUT="test.txt"

## Note: Replace "test.txt" with any other input file to generate output for different data.
- Upon execution, the program will read from the specified input file and produce an output file named [input_filename]_output_file.txt (e.g., test_output_file.txt for test.txt).

# Cleaning Output Files
## To remove all output files generated by the program, use the clean command:
- make clean
- This command will delete all files ending with _output_file.txt in the current directory.
