# Running the Program
## To execute the program, use the make command, specifying the INPUT variable as the input filename. By default, INPUT is set to test.txt.
- make INPUT="input_filename"

# Example
## To use test.txt as the input file:
### Run the following command:
- make INPUT="test.txt"

## If you want to use a different file, replace test.txt with your chosen file name:
- make INPUT="your_input_file.txt"
- Upon execution, the program will read from the specified input file and produce an output file named [input_filename]_output_file.txt. For instance, using test.txt as the input will generate an output file named test_output_file.txt.

# Cleaning Output Files
## To remove all output files generated by the program, use the clean command:
- make clean
- This command will delete all files ending with _output_file.txt in the current directory.
